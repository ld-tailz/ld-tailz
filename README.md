Hi, I'm Tran Long Do—but you can call me Tailz! 🇻🇳

I'm a secondary student who's passionate about all things tech. By day, I focus on my studies, and by night, I dive deep into programming and penetration testing. I'm also a Linux enthusiast 🐧 and use it as my daily driver. So I can proudly say, "I USE LINUX BTW." Jokes aside, it's an amazing operating system, and you should definitely give it a try!
